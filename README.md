**fbi** is a library for diffing and patching text files for .NET, directly inspired by [Chicken-Bones/DiffPatch](https://github.com/Chicken-Bones/DiffPatch).

This project is currently in its infancy and will receive tweaks and refinements for both API usage and performance as it's battle-tested in my own applications. As time progresses, it will move further away from being essentially a fork of `DiffPatch`.
